# How to generate and air gap PGP private keys using GnuPG, Tails and YubiKey

> Heads-up: guide inspired by https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide.

## Requirements

- [Tails USB flash drive or SD card](../how-to-install-tails-on-usb-flash-drive-or-sd-card) with VeraCrypt [installed](../how-to-install-and-use-veracrypt-on-tails)
- YubiKey with [OpenPGP](https://www.yubico.com/us/store/compare/) support (firmware version `5.2.3` or higher)
- Computer running macOS Catalina or Big Sur

## Caveats

- When copy/pasting commands that start with `$`, strip out `$` as this character is not part of the command
- When copy/pasting commands that start with `cat << "EOF"`, select all lines at once (from `cat << "EOF"` to `EOF` inclusively) as they are part of the same (single) command

## Setup guide (on Tails)

### Step 1: boot to Tails and set admin password

> Heads-up: if keyboard layout of computer isn’t “English (US)”, set “Keyboard Layout”.

Click “+” under “Additional Settings”, then “Administration Password”, set password, click “Add” and, finally, click “Start Tails”.

### Step 2: establish network connection using ethernet cable or Wi-Fi and wait for Tor to be ready

Connected to Tor successfully

### Step 3: import Dennis Fokin’s and Emil Lundberg’s PGP public keys (used to verify downloads below)

> Heads-up: release may be signed by [another](https://developers.yubico.com/Software_Projects/Software_Signing.html) Yubico developer.

```console
$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search-keys 9E885C0302F9BB9167529C2D5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1
gpg: data source: https://keys.openpgp.org:443
(1)	Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>

gpg: key 0x5CBA11E6ADC7BCD1: public key "Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1

$ gpg --keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org --search-keys 57a9deed4c6d962a923bb691816f3ed99921835e
gpg: data source: https://keys.openpgp.org:443
(1)	Emil Lundberg (Software Developer) <emil@yubico.com>
	  4096 bit RSA key 0x816F3ED99921835E, created: 2017-08-03
Keys 1-1 of 1 for "57a9deed4c6d962a923bb691816f3ed99921835e".  Enter number(s), N)ext, or Q)uit > 1
gpg: key 0x816F3ED99921835E: public key "Emil Lundberg (Software Developer) <emil@yubico.com>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

imported: 1

👍

### Step 4: download [YubiKey Manager](https://www.yubico.com/support/download/yubikey-manager/) AppImage release and associated PGP signature

```console
$ torsocks curl -L -o ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/Releases/yubikey-manager-qt-latest-linux.AppImage
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   282  100   282    0     0    300      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   299
100 82.2M  100 82.2M    0     0   953k      0  0:01:28  0:01:28 --:--:--  629k

$ torsocks curl -L -o ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage.sig https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager-qt/Releases/yubikey-manager-qt-latest-linux.AppImage.sig
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   286  100   286    0     0    318      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--   317
100   310  100   310    0     0    262      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:--   262
```

### Step 5: verify “YubiKey Manager” AppImage release (learn how [here](../how-to-verify-pgp-digital-signatures-using-gnupg-on-macos)) and make AppImage executable

```console
$ gpg --verify ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage.sig
gpg: assuming signed data in '/home/amnesia/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage'
gpg: Signature made Wed 10 Nov 2021 11:11:13 AM UTC
gpg:                using RSA key D6919FBF48C484F3CB7B71CD870B88256690D8BC
gpg: Good signature from "Dennis Fokin <dennis.fokin@yubico.com>" [unknown]
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 9E88 5C03 02F9 BB91 6752  9C2D 5CBA 11E6 ADC7 BCD1
     Subkey fingerprint: D691 9FBF 48C4 84F3 CB7B  71CD 870B 8825 6690 D8BC

$ chmod +x ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage
```

Good signature

👍

### Step 6: create and source `ykman` Bash alias

```
echo 'alias ykman="$HOME/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage ykman"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Step 7 (optional): copy “YubiKey Manager” AppImage to “Persistent” folder (requires Tails “Personal Data” persistence feature to be enabled)

> Heads-up: once copied, one can persistently run `~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage ykman` to manage YubiKeys.

```shell
cp ~/Downloads/yubikey-manager-qt.AppImage ~/Persistent/
```

### Step 8: generate master key (used to sign signing, encryption and authentication subkeys)

When asked for passphrase, create and memorize strong passphrase or use output from `gpg --gen-random --armor 0 24` (and store password in air-gapped password manager).

```console
$ gpg --expert --full-generate-key

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

### Step 9: set master key ID environment variable

> Heads-up: replace `0xC2709D13BAB4763C` with master key ID.

```shell
KEY_ID=0xC2709D13BAB4763C
```

### Step 10 (optional): sign master key using another master key

#### Import signing public key

> Heads-up: replace `/path/to/signing/pub.asc` with signing public key path.

```console
$ gpg --import '/path/to/signing/pub.asc'
gpg: key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745: public key "John Doe <john@example.net>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

#### Import signing private key

> Heads-up: replace `/path/to/signing/master.asc` with signing master key path.

```console
$ gpg --import /path/to/signing/master.asc
gpg: key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745: "John Doe <john@example.net>" not changed
gpg: key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:              unchanged: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
```

#### Sign master key

> Heads-up: replace `0xDFCECB410CE8A745` with signing master key ID.

```console
$ gpg --ask-cert-level --default-key 0xDFCECB410CE8A745 --sign-key $KEY_ID

### Step 12: mount backup volume (formatted using exFAT)

Click “Places”, then “Home”, then backup volume (“Samsung BAR” in example below), enter admin password and, finally, click “Authenticate”.

### Step 13: set backup volume name environment variable

```shell
VOLUME_NAME="Samsung BAR"
```

### Step 14: create VeraCrypt encrypted volume (used to store master key and subkeys)

```console
$ /home/amnesia/Persistent/veracrypt --text --create "/media/amnesia/$VOLUME_NAME/tails"
Volume type:
 1) Normal
 2) Hidden
Select [1]: 1

```

The VeraCrypt volume has been successfully created.

👍

### Step 15: mount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes”, then “Add”, select “tails” file on backup volume, click “Open”, enter password and, finally, click “Unlock”.

### Step 16: rename VeraCrypt encrypted volume

> Heads-up: replace `tcrypt-1793` with directory found using `ls /dev/mapper` and ignore dirty bit is set error.

```console
$ ls /dev/mapper
control  TailsData_unlocked  tcrypt-1793  tcrypt-1793_1  tcrypt-1793_2

$ sudo e2label /dev/mapper/tcrypt-1793 Tails
[sudo] password for amnesia:
```

### Step 17: set VeraCrypt encrypted volume name environment variable

> Heads-up: replace `8ff4dedf-6aa1-4b97-909d-63075b3eb70a` with directory found using `ls /media/amnesia`.

```console
$ ls /media/amnesia
8ff4dedf-6aa1-4b97-909d-63075b3eb70a

$ ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME="8ff4dedf-6aa1-4b97-909d-63075b3eb70a"
```

### Step 18: change owner of VeraCrypt encrypted volume

```shell
sudo chown amnesia:amnesia /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME
```

### Step 19: export master key, subkeys and public key to VeraCrypt encrypted volume

```console
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/master.asc

$ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/sub.asc

$ gpg --armor --export $KEY_ID > /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/pub.asc
```

### Step 20: copy public key to backup volume

> Heads-up: replace `johndoe` with name associated to master key.

```shell
cp /media/amnesia/$ENCRYPTED_VOLUME_NAME/pub.asc "/media/amnesia/$VOLUME_NAME/johndoe.asc"
```

### Step 21: dismount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes” and, finally, click “x”.

### Step 22: back up `tails` file

> Heads-up: files stored in `tails` include private keys which, if lost, results in loosing one’s cryptographic identity (safeguard backup mindfully).

> Heads-up: one should never unlock `tails` on macOS (or any other computer that isn’t air-gapped and hardened).

### Step 23: insert and provision YubiKey

> Heads-up: default user PIN is `123456` and default admin PIN is `12345678`.

> Heads-up: one should set different PIN for user vs admin and never use admin PIN on macOS (or any other computer that isn’t air-gapped and hardened).

### Step 25: require YubiKey user interaction for signing, encryption and authentication operations

```console
$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch sig on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch enc on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch aut on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp keys set-touch att on --force
Enter Admin PIN:

$ ykman openpgp info
OpenPGP version: 3.4
Application version: 5.4.3

PIN tries remaining: 3
Reset code tries remaining: 0
Admin PIN tries remaining: 3

Touch policies
Signature key           On
Encryption key          On
Authentication key      On
Attestation key         On
```

On

👍

### Step 26 (optional): disable all YubiKey interfaces except for OpenPGP over USB

> Heads-up: increase `sleep` delay if “Error: No YubiKey detected!” error is thrown.

```console
$ ykman config usb --disable FIDO2 --disable HSMAUTH --disable OATH --disable OTP --disable PIV --disable U2F --enable OPENPGP --force

$ ykman config nfc --disable-all --force
```

### Step 27 (optional): enable YubiKey configuration lock

> Heads-up: configuration lock prevents configuring YubiKey without entering lock code (store lock code in air-gapped password manager).

```console
$ ykman config set-lock-code --generate
Using a randomly generated lock code: cce9181f4a97bac00459419986510d40
Lock configuration with this lock code? [y/N]: y
```

### Step 28: shutdown computer

## Subkeys expiry date extension guide (on Tails)

### Step 1: boot to Tails and set admin password

> Heads-up: if keyboard layout of computer isn’t “English (US)”, set “Keyboard Layout”.

Click “+” under “Additional Settings”, then “Administration Password”, set password, click “Add” and, finally, click “Start Tails”.

### Step 2: mount backup volume (formatted using exFAT)

Click “Places”, then “Home”, then backup volume (“Samsung BAR” in example below), enter admin password and, finally, click “Authenticate”.

### Step 3: mount VeraCrypt encrypted volume

Click “Applications”, then “Utilities”, then “Unlock VeraCrypt Volumes”, then “Add”, select “tails” file on backup volume, click “Open”, enter password and, finally, click “Unlock”.

### Step 4: import master key

```console
$ gpg --import /media/amnesia/Tails/master.asc
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: 1 signature not checked due to a missing key
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: public key "John Doe <john@example.net>" imported
gpg: key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C: secret key imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
gpg:       secret keys read: 1
gpg:   secret keys imported: 1
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
```

### Step 5: set master key ID environment variable

```shell
KEY_ID=0xC2709D13BAB4763C
```

### Step 6: extend expiry date of signing, encryption and authentication subkeys

```console
$ gpg --edit-key $KEY_ID

#### Back up and overwrite `gpg-agent.conf`

Heads-up: back up current config using `cp ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf.backup` (if necessary).

```shell
cat << EOF > ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
default-cache-ttl 60
default-cache-ttl-ssh 60
enable-ssh-support
max-cache-ttl 120
max-cache-ttl-ssh 120
pinentry-program $(brew --prefix)/bin/pinentry-mac
EOF
```

### Step 8: configure shell

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> ~/.zshrc
export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
gpg-connect-agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY /bye > /dev/null
EOF
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Step 9: generate SSH public key

> Heads-up: replace `john@example.net` with email and `johndoe` with name associated to master key.

```console
$ mkdir -p ~/.ssh

$ ssh-add -L | awk  '{print $1 " " $2 " john@example.net"}' | tee ~/.ssh/johndoe.pub
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIJ62kuKCXcufbvQeXS8h5D6PW233AMBXHzKpXO0EhmJ6 john@example.net
```

ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3Nz… john@example.net

👍

### Step 10: reload `gpg-agent` (required to enable `pinentry-mac`)

```console
$ gpgconf --kill gpg-agent

$ gpgconf --launch gpg-agent

$ gpg-connect-agent UPDATESTARTUPTTY /bye
OK
```

OK

👍

### Step 11 (optional): enable Git [signing](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work)

```shell
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global gpg.program $(which gpg)
git config --global user.signingkey $KEY_ID
```

### Step 12 (optional): publish public key to hkps://keys.openpgp.org

```console
$ gpg --send-keys $KEY_ID
gpg: sending key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
```

gpg: sending key 0xC2709D13BAB4763C to hkps://keys.openpgp.org
