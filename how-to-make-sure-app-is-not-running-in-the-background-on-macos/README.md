# How to make sure app is not running in the background on macOS

[![How to make sure app is not running in the background on macOS](how-to-make-sure-app-is-not-running-in-the-background-on-macos.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSibcNslSK8 "How to make sure app is not running in the background on macOS")

## Requirements

- Computer running macOS Catalina or Big Sur

## Caveats

- When copy/pasting commands that start with `$`, strip out `$` as this character is not part of the command
- When copy/pasting commands that start with `cat << "EOF"`, select all lines at once (from `cat << "EOF"` to `EOF` inclusively) as they are part of the same (single) command

## Setup guide

> Heads-up: following steps illustrate how to make sure “Adobe Creative Suite” is not running in the background, but same logic should apply any app.

### Step 1: find app launch agent and daemon bundle identifier prefix

```console
$ ls -A1 {,~}/Library/LaunchAgents /Library/LaunchDaemons
/Library/LaunchAgents:
at.obdev.LittleSnitchHelper.plist
at.obdev.LittleSnitchUIAgent.plist
com.adobe.ARMDCHelper.cc24aef4a1b90ed56a725c38014c95072f92651fb65e1bf9c8e43c37a23d420d.plist
com.adobe.AdobeCreativeCloud.plist
com.adobe.GC.AGM.plist
com.adobe.GC.Invoker-1.0.plist
com.adobe.ccxprocess.plist

/Library/LaunchDaemons:
at.obdev.littlesnitchd.plist
com.adobe.ARMDC.Communicator.plist
com.adobe.ARMDC.SMJobBlessHelper.plist
com.adobe.acc.installer.v2.plist
com.adobe.agsservice.plist
com.apple.installer.osmessagetracing.plist
local.pf.plist
local.pmset.plist
local.spoof.plist
org.virtualbox.startup.plist
org.wireshark.ChmodBPF.plist

/Users/sunknudsen/Library/LaunchAgents/:
com.adobe.GC.Invoker-1.0.plist
local.borg-wrapper.plist
org.virtualbox.vboxwebsrv.plist
```

com.adobe

### Step 2: disable app launch agents and daemons

> Heads-up: don’t worry if you see “Could not find specified service” warnings.

```shell
BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX="com.adobe"
sudo launchctl unload -w /Library/{LaunchAgents,LaunchDaemons}/$BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX*.plist
launchctl unload -w {,~}/Library/LaunchAgents/$BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PREFIX*.plist
```

### Step 3: disable app extensions

Open “System Preferences”, click “Extensions” and disable app extensions (if any).

![core-sync](./core-sync.png?shadow=1)

### Step 4: add `kill-apps` helper to `.zshrc`

> Heads-up: following step assumes macOS is configured to use “Z shell” (running `echo $SHELL` should return `/bin/zsh`).

```shell
cat << "EOF" >> ~/.zshrc

# Kill apps that match string
function kill-apps() {
  IFS=$'\n'
  red=$(tput setaf 1)
  normal=$(tput sgr0)
  if [ -z "$1" ] || [ "$1" = "--help" ]; then
    printf "%s\n" "Usage: kill-apps string"
    return 0
  fi
  printf "%s\n" "Finding apps that match “$1”…"
  sleep 1
  processes=($(pgrep -afil "$1"))
  if [ ${#processes[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    printf "%s\n" "No apps found"
    return 0
  else
    printf "%s\n" "${processes[@]}"
    printf "$red%s$normal" "Kill found apps (y or n)? "
    read -r answer
    if [ "$answer" = "y" ]; then
      printf "%s\n" "Killing found apps…"
      sleep 1
      for process in "${processes[@]}"; do
        echo $process | awk '{print $1}' | xargs sudo kill 2>&1 | grep -v "No such process"
      done
      printf "%s\n" "Done"
      return 0
    fi
  fi
}
EOF
source ~/.zshrc
```
